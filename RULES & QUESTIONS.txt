----------------------RULES-----------------------
There may be no white spaces between expresions

No parser toll allowed except strtok

If there are nested statement in input print syntax error

In the case of syntax error:
    Write the line number
    Write syntax error
    Do not produce llvm file
    Stop after first error

There cannot be lines containing:
    only a variable like : line --> a
    only multiple variables : a, b, c, (?)
    only number : line --> 12
    only some equation : line --> 3+a+b
    only choose() function

There can be an undefined variable in an expression :
    d = 5
    d = c + d + 3
    (c will be threated as zero)

Allowed Lines Full List:
    - Empty
    - #comment
    - if (<exp>) {
    - while (<exp>) {
    - print(<exp>)
    - assignment "="
    - }

Tabs-spaces not important

Case sensetive

You do not have to check if the input is 32 bits

***There can be nested choose() function

***There can be a statement like:
    print(a+10*choose(b,c,d,e))

While running the file we expect just one argument which is the file give error otherwise

----------------------QUESTIONS---------------------

Should we change to postfix notation using a stack or the one which proffesor mentioned?
